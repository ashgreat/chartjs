Description: Build responsive, accessible Chart.js visualisations directly from
    R. The package wraps the Chart.js v4 renderer with a modern R API including
    type-specific helpers, sensible defaults, Shiny proxy utilities, and
    first-class support for custom options. Generate bar, line, scatter, bubble,
    radar, pie, doughnut, and polar area charts without writing JavaScript and
    integrate them in R Markdown, Shiny, or htmlwidgets workflows.
